How to Contribute to fiendly-words
================
Go away! We don't want your help. Get off our lawn. Unless you have great, fiendly words (and bugfixes). This should have all the information you need to do so. 

Workflow
----------------
We prefer changes to come through GitHub at this point (we're still working on branch/merge features in Glitch!). 

*If you're submitting a bugfix:*
- Open a GitHub issue with a descriptive title, clear description and steps to reproduce.

*If you're suggesting improvements/new words:*
- Fiendish, evil only please

*For all changes:*
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

If you aren't comfortable with GitHub, don't have an account, etc, we also accept post cards if you can figure out the mailing address. But only if they're rubbish postcards.

Updating the NPM module
-----------------------

Yeah, there isn't one. If you want one, fiendly words isn't for you and you'll need those nice _friendly_ words from Glitch. You know where to go.
